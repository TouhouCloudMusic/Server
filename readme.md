# TouhouCloudMusic
TouhouCloudMusic is a website for crowdsourcing music tags. Users can edit the tags and details of every track. The goal is to make this an open platform that includes full data on hundreds of thousands of tracks. It should also offer a user-friendly, visually appealing front-end interface for users to search, browse, and edit information about music with ease.

# Contribute to TouhouCloudMusic
Our project team has two kinds of contributors: programmers who are skilled but short on time, and Touhou music enthusiasts who have the time but not the programming skills. With the availability from the programmers limited, many of our music enthusiasts are taking it upon themselves to learn programming and are building the prototype from scratch. Progress goes along, but at a slow and sure pace, and we are committed to the project.

If you bring skills in any of the areas of front-end development, UI design, and database management-and most importantly, the time to contribute-we would love your help to take our website further into its development.
